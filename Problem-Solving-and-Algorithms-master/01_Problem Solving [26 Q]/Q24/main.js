/* findBubbleSort */

/*  
Bubble sort is considered the most basic sorting algorithm . It works by starting at the first element of an array and comparing it to the second element:
  • If the first element is greater than the second element, it swaps the two.
  • It then compares the second to the third, and the third to the fourth, and so on.
    - In this way, the largest values 'bubble' to the end of the array.
  • Once it gets to the end of the array, it starts over and repeats the process until the array is sorted numerically.
